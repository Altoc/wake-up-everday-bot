# wake-up-everday-bot
 This is a twitter bot that... wakes up everday!!!
 
 @WakeEverday on twitter to see the result.
 
 If you want to make a similar bot using this project, add a mp4 video for the bot to post to twitter. By default, `main.py` will look for './vid.mp4'.
 Also, you'll need some twitter developer permissions. Add your OAuth1 tokens into a file, './keys.env'.
 
 Then you ought to be good to go. Bot posts at 8:00am by default.
